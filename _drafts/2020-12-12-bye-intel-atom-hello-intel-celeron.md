I was always a big fan of Intel Atom lineup. I'm also really into small form factor and powerful PCs.

That is why I have bought Cooler Master 120 (link here) a long time ago and have been on ITX motherboard with 670GTX and later with 1070GTX.

But small computers while being very minimalistic and are very creative in how to utilize space inside and outside the case, are significantly louder than their bigger brothers.

Some time ago I noticed that Intel Atom lineup stopped being developed and I wondered what happened with that. Well recently I started poking around small and efficient x86 motherboards and it turns out they were replaced by Celeron Lineup.

This post is an introduction but also a helpful tool when looking around for celeron processors.

First of all, if You are looking for alternative to Intel NUC, check out products from BeeLink or Qotom.
