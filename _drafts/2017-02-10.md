Today I was hit with uncommon limit of 32765 sub directories on my file
system. I am using paperclip on production aplication. And today we hit
our 32765th attachment (Yay!), but after that, filesystem told us
"Input/output error". Bear in mind that my attachments are availble by
nfs wchich share is hosted on FreeBSD. So I googled for "file limit of
UFS" and didn't get anything. So I asked on my favorite ##techsupport
IRC. And sure enough I got and anwser by @PipeItToDevNull (thanks bro!)
who gave me this link:
http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1484502 And that is enough
for me. I hit the limit, so I had to came up with new structure for files.

But how I got into this situation in the first place? Well, my project
is ruby on rails based and I use paperclip gem to handle attachments.
And today was a day when my users created 32765th attachment in my
application.

To solve this problem I asked my co-worker for help. And with his help
we came up with this path structure:
/storage/:id_divided_by_1000000/:id_divided_by_1000/:id_modulo_1000/file.extension

This way I will be able to handle 32k*1kk files which is sufficient for
this project. Of course I have to migrate old files and this will only
work for integer based id's.

Paperclip.interpolates :id_divided_by_1000000 do |attachment, style|
(attachment.instance.id / 1_000_000).to_i
end
