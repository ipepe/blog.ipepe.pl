In response to my recent blog post. I organized a bounty search on reddit (<https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/k8f4zn/looking_for_ruby_tests_filtering_based_on_changed/>):
```
I remember watching a presentation a few years ago about prototype/proof of concept/demo/library/set of tools that based on code coverage, and lines of code changed, it would calculate which tests should be run. I can't find it now, can You help me find it?

I'm setting a bounty for a first person to accurately link a video, I will pay out $15*. (preferred game platform of Your choice, charity or Paypal).

In the process I found some interesting resources:
