only use gaia hq and sometimes cg
if a video is blurry then downscale it before running it in topaz. you probably wont lose any detail and topaz only works well when the video is reasonably sharp for its resolution
stick to 100% deblock/denoise for most things to make the video look better at the same resolution
ai upscaling isnt worth it most of the time because you need a good quality video in the first place and 4chan is stuck with vp8 and a 4mb limit so a 1080p60 video will look like shit anyway if it's more than 3 seconds

these three were upscaled and i still lowered the res when uploading. i uploaded the original version of the first for comparison

for a really low quality low res video full of artifacts you could run it through gaia cg at 200%, downscale it, then run it again with gaia hq
