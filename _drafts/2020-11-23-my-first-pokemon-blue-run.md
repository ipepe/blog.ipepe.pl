It was still faster than me playing original Pokemon Blue when it came out in 1998. I didn't know english then because I was 7 years old, so I basically brute forced through game. When stuck, I would talk to every NPC that were in my range for the whole game. On my first run I was stuck for like a week because I didn't know how to go through "catching pokemon tutorial" and to make the matters worse, I didn't learn from it, so I basically run through whole game with charmander. I remeber very clearly by the time I left cruise ship, my chameleon evolved into Charizard.
