In a project some time ago we started writing a validation for PESEL field.

It is special number that identifies every person living on polish soil.

It had very specific format with birthdate encoded, gender and even a checksum.

Well, there is an issue with that: Years ago, there was some change of someone calculating that number manually and validation failed.
