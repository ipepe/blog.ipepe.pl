In recent year I went through quite few MacBook chargers. Some of them died randomly, some of them had their cables being shreded because of age and frequent usage.
I started collecting statistics how much does charger weigh.  

| OEM 2020 | OEM 2015| V. Good Fake | "Replacement" | GreenCell |
|----------|---------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| 293g     | 262g    | 270g         | 212g          | 202g      |

Additionally when You have a chance to plug in charger to Your MacBook. You can spot a fake by timing how fast does green/orange light come on. In original MacBook charger, it comes on after a second or two. For fakes, it comes immediately after plugging it in.
