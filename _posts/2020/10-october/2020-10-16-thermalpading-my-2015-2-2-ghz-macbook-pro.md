Results are not promising. Overall chasis temperature increased on the bottom cover and that is highly unpleasant. CPU Temperature at stress didn't lower that much (to 78°C from 81°C), barely anything in my opinion.

Probably I will get better results when thermalpadding my 2015 2,8GHz Macbook Pro because CPU works there on 99°C when in stress. And probably it could go higher but it is thermal throttling a lot.

For anyone wondering I ordered `Thermopad AG 20x130x2mm 6W/mk` 

2mm of thickness is more than enough. I personally had to push bottom cover for screws to even be able to thread in.

Depends what You want to achieve. If You want more thermalpad squish. Order 2mm, if You prefer to not squish them so much then go for 1,5mm.

To cover heatpipes You need 3 packages. But if You have two MacBooks You can probably cover them both with 5 packages.
