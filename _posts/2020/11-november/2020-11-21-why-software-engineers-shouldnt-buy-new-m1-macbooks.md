As always when something new and shiny comes out, it's really hard not to be under impression that new something is better and if I had that new something, I would operate much more efficiently. 

This post gives You 5 reasons why You shouldn't buy newest Macs with Apple M1 processors.  

## 1. Homebrew
Native extensions in libraries might not be supported. List of supported libraries is here: <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857> 

## 2. Docker

## 3. External monitors
Mac Mini supports 2 external monitors. And MacBook Pro and MacBook Air only support 1 external monitor.

## 4. Virtualization
x86 virtualization is not yet supported

## 5. Security
As these machines have pretty much new and untested from secuirty standpoint of view platform. Especially considering how many security holes Intel processors had, I wouldn't be suprised there might be many of them in the first ever ARM processor by Apple.

For now we can say there is at least one: <https://cntechpost.com/2020/11/18/security-vulnerabilities-in-apple-m1-chip-devices-iphone-12-pro/>

```
Tencent Xuanwu Labs has successfully breached the latest MacBook equipped with the M1 chip and the iPhone 12 Pro using newly discovered security flaws, according to Tencent Security.

This may be the first publicly available security flaw that can affect Apple M1 chip devices.

Tencent Security said it recently discovered that by exploiting a vulnerability of the M1 chip, it is possible to bypass the system's restrictions on app permissions.

The team demonstrated the upgrade from normal to root privileges on a MacBook using the latest Apple M1 chip.

The version number of the system on the device is macOS Big Sur 11.0.1, the device model is MacBook Air (m1, 2020), and the chip is M1.
```

## 6. Don't pay early adopter's tax
While being effective programmer is really important, what I value more is being reliable programmer.
