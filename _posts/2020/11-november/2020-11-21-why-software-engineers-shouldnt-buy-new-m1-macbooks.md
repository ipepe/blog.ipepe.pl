As always when something new and shiny comes out, it's really hard not to be under impression that new something is better and if I had that new something, I would operate much more efficiently. 

This post gives You 5 reasons why You shouldn't buy newest Macs with Apple M1 processors.  

## 1. Homebrew
Native extensions in libraries might not be supported. List of supported libraries is here: <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857> 

## 2. Docker

## 3. External monitors
Mac Mini supports 2 external monitors. And MacBook Pro and MacBook Air only support 1 external monitor.

## 4. Virtualization
x86 virtualization is not yet supported
## 5. Don't pay early adopter's tax
While being effective programmer is really important, what I value more is being reliable programmer.
