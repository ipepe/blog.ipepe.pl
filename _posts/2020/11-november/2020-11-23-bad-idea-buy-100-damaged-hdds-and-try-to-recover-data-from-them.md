For a few years I'm fighting with spending some $$$ on a lot of damaged HDDs.

The idea is that in a lot of say 100 HDDs there will be some that will be detectable by BIOS/OS and some data should be recoverable from them. Interesting to see what they could hide

Maybe a good idea for YouTube series?
