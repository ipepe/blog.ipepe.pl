I finally received V2 of my PCB Design for use with ESP32 microcontrollers. It should be perfect for servo based robots but also other projects as well.

For future reference it was ordered on 2020-11-05 and shipped on 2020-11-07.

Can't wait to try it out, but I don't think I will have any time soon to test it.
