title: Denso Cruise Control Throttle Controller
---

I bought a Denso MX100300-1170 throttle cable control motor from an Accord 1.8 from 1998. Used to operate throttle body with steel cable. It is factory-controlled with proprietary Honda module.

I was able to find a video on YouTube showing how to check if the module works.
https://youtu.be/y1yX6hZjWAI?t=1265
(Honda Cruise Control Troubleshooting and Combination Switch Replacement on Accord 2.4L 2004) in the 21st minute it is explained how the module is working.

But if, sometime in the future, the video is unavailable:

This module has an ordinary electric motor but with spiral gears and with an electromagnetic clutch. You can test is very easily with simple 12 volt battery and 4 wires.
 
As for the wires themselves and their markings. The first wire is the ground for the clutch, the second is a plus for the clutch, the third and fourth is the power supply to the electric motor and here is a nice thing, because we control this motor like any DC motor, e.g. a window lifting motor in a car. Depending on the plus or minus combination, the motor loosens the cable or tightens it.
