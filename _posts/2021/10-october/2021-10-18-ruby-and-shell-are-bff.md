title: Ruby and Shell are BFF

Ruby is a scripting language, here's a nice tutorial on how to use it in conjunction with the shell.
I recommend that you go through the introduction chapter and the tasks in it, the rest of it can be referred to if you need something more in the future.

TLDR: ruby > awk, grep, sed - unless the files to be analyzed are gigabytes
