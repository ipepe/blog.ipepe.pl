The pros of mirroring with QuickTime are many. It doesn't cost anything extra, the responsiveness is almost instant, and setting it up couldn't be easier.

The only con is that it requires a wired connection between the Mac and iOS device.

## Setting Up
Connect the iOS device to the Mac via a Lightning-to-USB cable. 

Note: This connection may cause iTunes and/or Image Capture to automatically launch. Those programs may start trying to syncing with the iDevice, and create lag. So be sure to close those applications before moving forward.

Once the device is connected, launch QuickTime. QuickTime will bring up a filepicker menu. The goal here isn't to play an existing file, so click Done.

From the menu bar, click File, then New Movie Recording.

## Setting iPhone as a QuickTime input
The default input device will be set to the iSight camera. To change it to the iOS device, click the down arrow next to the record button. Then select the iOS device from the camera list. The device's screen will instantly appear and any actions taken on the device will be mirrored to the Mac's display.

## Mirroring the iPhone to Mac using QuickTime
An added advantage of this method is that the record button is just one click away. Using QuickTime's built in recording feature makes creating iOS based screencasts a breeze.
